##Gas_Agency_Management_System

#Description:
This project deals with the ‘Gas Agency Management 
System’. The system will be used for booking of cylinders in 
accordance to the requirement of the consumer. It first takes 
in the consumer information who can then place the order 
for the cylinders with the required specifications which is 
then followed by making the payment and the consumer can 
see the details with respect to his order, payment and 
delivery hence making it foolproof and reliable for the 
consumer. This system would ease out the process for 
booking compared to doing it manually which would be a lot 
more tedious.

#Scope of the project:
The project uses SQL for the backend and Python for the 
front end with the streamlit library being pivotal. It consists 
of a website design which helps us to handle the basic tasks 
to place an order and make the payment. The main purpose 
is to help the consumer place his/her order without any 
hassle. With the consumption of fuel/cylinders being a 
demand and a must, it is important to provide a system 
which helps the consumers to efficiently book and receive 
their orders on time which is done through this project.
